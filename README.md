# Firstwebpage

Welcome to my very first HTML + CSS project! 🎉  
This is a one-page website I built to introduce myself in a fun and creative way.

## 👩‍💻 About This Project

This is not a professional portfolio — it's more like a digital "Hello!" from me.  
It’s a simple and friendly webpage with:

- A full-screen background image
- My photo on the left
- A fun and casual introduction on the right
- Some facts about me, my interests, and what I’m learning
- A cute button that gives a little interaction
  
#🧠 What I Learned

- Basic HTML page structure
- Linking CSS files to HTML
- Using background images in CSS
- Flexbox for side-by-side layouts
- Styling images and text with CSS
- Making a page look nice without JavaScript
